# Early-Identification-of-At-Risk-Students-Dropout-Prevention
This project uses data-driven techniques to identify students at risk of academic dropout in higher education. By analyzing early-stage student data, the model predicts potential academic failure, enabling timely interventions. The goal is to reduce dropout rates by providing insights and support strategies for at-risk students.
